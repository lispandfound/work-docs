== Scientific Validation
- Sensitivity studies for causality trees.
  - Cesar had ideas.
- Need to validate IMs.
  - Detailed study of Kaik≈çura?
- Refine hyperparameters
  - Need more data for this?
- Alpine fault ruptures (Brendon).

== Overview
#table(
  columns: (auto, auto, auto),
  stroke: none,
  fill: (rgb("EAF2F5"), none),
  table.header(
    [*Rupture Prop.*],
    [*Curved Geometry*],
    [*Slip Models*],
  ),

  [
    - We can generate multi-segment ruptures.
    - Approach is not _obviously_ wrong.

  [ - Hikurangi has curved geometry.],
