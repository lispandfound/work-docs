= Title Slide
= Context
== What we do
- We (who?) support earthquake researchers at UC in Civil Nat. Res department.
- The primary software application is ground motion simulation.

== Scale of NZ Cybershake
- Simulations of possible future events in the NSHM.
- Thousands of events simulated dozens of times each.
- Fixed workflow with millions of core-hours.
== Custom Researcher Workflows
- Unique workflows using components developed by RSE team.
- Possibly limited HPC background.
- Rapidly iterating.
== The Old Simulation Stack
- Cybershake-first, researcher second. Inflexible.
- Everything custom. NIH syndrome.
- Complicated environment. Brittle and difficult to reproduce.
= Technical Modernisation
